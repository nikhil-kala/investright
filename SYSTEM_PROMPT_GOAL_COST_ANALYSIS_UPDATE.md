  return {
    success: true,
    message: `${greeting}Great goal! To help you plan better, I need to understand two important things:\n\n1. What is your target timeline for achieving this goal? (e.g., 2 years, 5 years, 10 years)\n2. Do you know the approximate cost or value required for this goal? If not, I can help you research it.`
  };
}
```

**What this achieves:**

#### **Question 3 - Financial Capacity Assessment:**
```typescript
if (questionNumber === 3) {
  return {
    success: true,
    message: `${greeting}Thank you for sharing the timeline and cost information. Now let me ask about your current financial situation:\n\nWhat is your current monthly income and how much can you realistically allocate towards this goal each month?`
  };
}
```

**What this achieves:**

   - If user didn't provide cost, research and provide estimated cost for their specific goal
   - Break down the total cost into components if applicable
