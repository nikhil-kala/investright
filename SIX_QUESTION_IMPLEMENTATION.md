# 6-Question Dynamic Follow-up Implementation - InvestRight Chatbot

## 🎯 **Overview**
This document explains the implementation of the dynamic 6-question conversation flow for the InvestRight financial advisor chatbot, where the AI agent asks relevant follow-up questions based on the user's specific goal.

## 📋 **System Requirements Met**

### **Core Functionality:**
- ✅ **6 Questions Total**: Exactly 6 questions before providing financial plan
- ✅ **Dynamic Follow-ups**: AI generates relevant questions based on user's goal
- ✅ **Goal-Based Logic**: Questions adapt to the specific life goal mentioned
- ✅ **Professional Advice**: Comprehensive financial plan after collecting information

## 🔄 **New Conversation Flow**

### **Complete 6-Question Journey:**

```
1. Welcome + Life Goal Explanation + "Are you ready to start?"
2. User: "yes" → Bot: "What's your name?"
3. User: "John" → Bot: "What inspirational life goal do you have?"
4. User: "Buy a house in 5 years" → Bot: AI-Generated Question 2 (e.g., timeline details)
5. User: Answer → Bot: AI-Generated Question 3 (e.g., income/budget)
6. User: Answer → Bot: AI-Generated Question 4 (e.g., existing savings)
7. User: Answer → Bot: AI-Generated Question 5 (e.g., risk tolerance)
8. User: Answer → Bot: AI-Generated Question 6 (e.g., dependents/age)
9. User: Answer → Bot: Comprehensive Financial Plan & Investment Strategy
```

### **Message Count Logic:**
- **Messages 0-3**: Standard flow (Welcome → Ready → Name → Goal)
- **Messages 4-11**: Dynamic follow-up questions (4 additional questions)
- **Messages 12+**: Comprehensive financial advice generation

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **1. New Function: `generateRelevantQuestion()`**
```typescript
const generateRelevantQuestion = async (
  _userMessage: string,
  conversationHistory: Array<{ role: 'user' | 'assistant', content: string }>
): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string }> => {
  // AI-powered question generation based on conversation context
  // Falls back to predefined questions if AI fails
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Conversation Logic:**
```typescript
// After 4 messages, start asking relevant follow-up questions
if (conversationHistory.length >= 4 && conversationHistory.length < 12) {
  return await generateRelevantQuestion(userMessage, conversationHistory);
}

// After 6 questions (12 messages), provide financial advice
if (conversationHistory.length >= 12) {
  return await generateFinancialAdvice(userMessage, conversationHistory);
}
```

### **3. AI-Powered Question Generation:**
- **Context-Aware**: Analyzes user's stated goal and previous answers
- **Relevant Topics**: Focuses on timeline, income, savings, risk tolerance, family situation
- **Personalized**: Addresses user by name throughout
- **Professional Tone**: Maintains friendly, engaging conversation style

## 🎯 **Question Generation Strategy**

### **AI System Instruction:**
```
"You are an expert financial advisor. Based on the conversation history, 
generate the next relevant follow-up question to better understand the 
user's financial situation and goals.

Guidelines:
- Ask about specific details related to their stated goal
- Focus on financial capacity, timeline, current savings, income, expenses
- Ask about risk tolerance, investment experience, family situation
- Keep questions friendly, professional, and engaging
- Ask only ONE specific question
- Make it relevant to their stated goal"
```

### **Fallback Questions System:**
If AI generation fails, the system uses predefined relevant questions:
1. "What is your target timeline for achieving this goal?"
2. "What is your current monthly income and how much can you allocate?"
3. "Do you have any existing savings or investments for this goal?"
4. "How would you describe your risk tolerance?"
5. "What is your current age and do you have any financial dependents?"

## 📱 **Example User Journey**

### **House Purchase Goal Example:**
```
1. Bot: Welcome message + Life goal explanation + "Are you ready to start?"
2. User: "Yes"
3. Bot: "What's your name?"
4. User: "Sarah"
5. Bot: "Nice to meet you, Sarah! What inspirational life goal do you have?"
6. User: "I want to buy a house in Mumbai in 3 years"
7. Bot: "Sarah, what's your target budget for the house you want to purchase?"
8. User: "Around ₹80 lakhs"
9. Bot: "Sarah, what's your current monthly income and savings rate?"
10. User: "₹1.2 lakhs per month, can save ₹40,000"
11. Bot: "Sarah, do you have any existing savings for this house purchase?"
12. User: "₹15 lakhs in FD and ₹5 lakhs in savings account"
13. Bot: "Sarah, how comfortable are you with market-linked investments?"
14. User: "Moderate risk tolerance"
15. Bot: "Sarah, do you have any other financial commitments or dependents?"
16. User: "Supporting parents with ₹10,000 monthly"
17. Bot: *Generates comprehensive financial plan for house purchase*
```
